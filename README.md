Its appearance is haunting, with glowing yellow eyes and a menacing demeanor. Valak represents the embodiment of evil, feeding off fear and despair to fuel its malevolent intentions.

The Vatican dispatches Father Burke, a priest with a haunted past, and Sister Irene, a novitiate, to investigate the incident.
